# Overview of the Project
### Initially, code was written to analyze about a dozen stocks. It is determined that this code may not work well for thousands of stocks, and if it does, it may take a long time to execute. The code needs to be refactored to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information.

# Results
### The stocks analyzed in the project saw a much greater return in 2017, with only one security yielding a negative return. However in 2018, two of the twelve stocks showed a positive return.
